				<b>Legal Disputes. </b>You agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between you and Dualities will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section. Please read this Section carefully.&nbsp; It affects your rights and will have a substantial impact on how claims between Dualities and You are resolved.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<u>Applicable Law</u>.&nbsp; You agree that the laws of the State of New Jersey, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between You and Dualities, except as otherwise stated in this Agreement.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<u>Agreement to Arbitrate</u>.&nbsp; You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between Dualities and You shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that You may assert claims in small claims court, if the claim qualifies.&nbsp; The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<u>Arbitration Procedures</u>.&nbsp; Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.&nbsp; Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.&nbsp; However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.&nbsp; An arbitrator also must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA&#39;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.&nbsp; The AAA&#39;s rules are available at www.adr.org.&nbsp; A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA&#39;s website at http://www.adr.org.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The arbitration shall be held in the county in which Dualities is incorporated.&nbsp; If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, Dualities and You may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on Dualities and You subject to the arbitrator&#39;s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.&nbsp; Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by Dualities and You unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving you to the extent required by applicable law.&nbsp; The arbitrator&#39;s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<u>Costs of Arbitration</u>.&nbsp; Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&#39;s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.&nbsp; In the event the arbitrator determines that the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Dualities for all fees associated with the arbitration.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<u>Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes</u>.&nbsp; Unless You and We agree otherwise, in the event that the Agreement to Arbitrate above is found not to apply to You or to a particular claim or dispute, as a result of a court order, You agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between You and We must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in New Jersey.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dualities and You agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within Morris County, New Jersey for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

			<p>
				If any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable, such unenforceability shall not make any other provision hereof unenforceable.&nbsp; Any reference to any party includes its agents and employees.&nbsp; If any provisions of this Agreement conflict with any statute or rule of law in any jurisdiction wherein it may be sought to be enforced, then said provisions shall be deemed null and void to such extent, but without invalidating the remaining provisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				The remedies of this Agreement provided in favor of either party shall not be deemed exclusive, but shall be cumulative, and shall be in addition to all other remedies in its favor existing at law or in equity.&nbsp; The failure or delay of either party in exercising any right granted it hereunder upon any occurrence of any of the contingencies set forth herein shall not constitute a waiver of any such right upon the continuation or recurrence of any such contingencies or similar contingencies and any single or partial exercise of any particular right by either party shall not exhaust the same or constitute a waiver of any other right provided herein.
			</p>
			<p>
				Any failure by either party to require strict performance by the other party of any term, covenants or agreements herein shall not be construed as a consent or waiver of any breach of the same or of any other term, covenant or agreement herein.
			</p>
			<p>
				This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement and understanding among the parties, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous proposals, oral or written, understandings, covenants, agreements, arrangements and communications between them relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

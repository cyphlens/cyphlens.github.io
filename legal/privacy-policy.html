			<p>This is the first version of Dualities Privacy Policy and is effective as of July 18th, 2019. 
				<b>Dualities Inc</b>&nbsp;(&ldquo;<b>Dualities</b>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<b>we</b>&rdquo;, or &ldquo;<b>us</b>&rdquo;) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information that is collected through our web based application and/or our mobile application and/or our website (collectively, our &ldquo;Service&rdquo;), as well as your choices regarding the collection and use of information.
			</p>
			<p>
				This Privacy Policy describes how and when Dualities collects, uses and shares your information when you use our Services. When using any of our Services, you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize Dualities to use your information in the United States and any other country where Dualities operates.
			</p>

				If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a class="st" href="mailto:support@cyphme.com">support@cyphme.com</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Some of the information we collect</b>:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Information Collected Upon Registration.</b> When you create or reconfigure an account with Dualities, you provide some personal information, including, but not limited to social media information such as but not limited to your Twitter (username, password, email address) and Facebook account information (username, password).&nbsp; Further, residential and/or business information including address, state, zip code, etc. may be collected. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, may be listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, may not require registration.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Account Information.</b> This includes at least your user name, and e-mail address;
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Network Performance &amp; Usage Information.</b> This tells us how you use our network, our products and our services, and how well our equipment and network is performing;
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Web Browsing &amp; Wireless Application Information.</b> This tells us about the websites you visit and the mobile applications you use whilst logged in to our network;
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Location Information.</b> This tells us where your wireless device is located, as well as your zip code and street address;
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Geolocation.</b> We may collect your location through GPS, Wi-Fi, or wireless network triangulation in order to obtain your location for the purposes of providing our Service. We may use geolocation data to build a history of occurrences of observed events that are the intent of Dualities, in order to bring the most relevant information to you.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Cookies.</b> Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer&#39;s hard disk. Dualities may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Log Data.</b> Our servers may automatically record information (&quot;Log Data&quot;) created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We may receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our website(s) or use our apps or otherwise sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your Dualities account to authenticate to a third-party website or application, or visit a third-party website that includes a Dualities button or widget. Dualities uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Third-Parties.</b> Dualities may use a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our blog(s), and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure ad quality and tailor ads. For example, this allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in. If you prefer, you can turn off tailored ads in your privacy settings so that your account is not matched to information shared by ad partners for tailoring ads.
